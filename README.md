# DroneDeploy---MaptoPDF

Creates a PDF of the map in view for the Zoom Level Input.

Created as part of DroneDeploy Take Home test.

Design Process:

1.) Read through documentation, set up sample project <br>
2.) Use API to get Current Plan, Tiles, and annotations <br>
3.) Refactor code after confirmed working to optimize code <br>
4.) Implement Heroku to create the PDF File <br>
5.) Add zoom selection field, document code, clean up and refactor again <br><br>

Summary:

Overall the project was a bit more involved than originally expected, learned a lot that I hadnt expected to throughout the project. I found the challenge demonstrated the overall ease of use of the DroneDeploy platform to quickly create custom Apps.
