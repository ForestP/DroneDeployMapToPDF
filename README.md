# DroneDeploy---MaptoPDF

Creates a PDF of the map in view for the Zoom Level Input.

Created as part of DroneDeploy Take Home test.

Design Process:

1.) Read through documentation, set up sample project
2.) Use API to get Current Plan, Tiles, and annotations
3.) Refactor code after confirmed working to optimize code
4.) Implement Heroku to create the PDF File
5.) Add zoom selection field, document code, clean up and refactor again

Summary:

Overall the project was a bit more involved than originally expected, learned a lot that I hadnt expected to throughout the project. I found the challenge demonstrated the overall ease of use of the DroneDeploy platform to quickly create custom Apps.
